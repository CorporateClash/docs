# Acceptable Usage Policy

For the purposes of these terms, 'we', 'our', or 'us' shall refer to the entity Corporate Clash, and 'you' shall refer to the API user, whether that be a company or individual implementing and consuming these APIs.

General rules:

- Do not store or transmit user login details (username/password/email) or long-lived login tokens to a server where those details would be reasonably easy to be readable by you. For example, it would be acceptable to  store these via a users' existing storage service (Google Drive, Dropbox), but if it were stored on a server that specifically enabled functionality in your launcher, it would need to be stored in a reasonably encrypted manner, unreadable by you.
- Do not abuse our API by sending an unreasonably number of requests per second. If we return rate limiting headers or otherwise implement rate-limiting mechanisms, you must follow them.
- Do not perform illegal acts using our services, or otherwise enable others to perform illegal acts using our services.
- Comply with all United States and applicably user-bound privacy laws where applicable.
- We may require registration or contact before certain APIs are usable by you. If so, you should not attempt to access these APIs without performing such requirement.
- Do not attempt to access private APIs, including admin/staff/moderation APIs. Most of these are marked with an API version of '0' somewhere in the API request, however, you should assume they're private if they're not listed here.
- You agree that we might monitor the use of our APIs, and might restrict access if compliance with these rules is not met.
- If you provide feedback or suggestions about our APIs, then we (and those we allow) may use such information without obligation to you.
- These rules are non-exclusive. You acknowledge that we may develop products or services that may compete with any of our or your products or services.
- You will not make any statement regarding your use of an API which suggests partnership with, sponsorship by, or endorsement by us without our prior written approval.
- In the course of promoting, marketing, or demonstrating the APIs you are using and our associated products, we may produce and distribute incidental depictions, including screenshots, video, or other content from your API Client, and may use your company or product name. You grant us all necessary rights for the above purposes.
